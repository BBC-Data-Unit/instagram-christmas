In December 2015 we [wrote a festive story](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35112577) on the 'most Christmassy' cities in England, based on data scraped from Instagram. 

BBC News used an independent data scraping tool to search Instagram for any mentions of Christmas.
We looked for the top 10 cities for population in England with a hashtag (#) in front of them followed by the words "Christmas" or "Xmas" somewhere in the accompanying caption.
